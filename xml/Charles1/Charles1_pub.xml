            <handNote>In the manuscript of 1825, Mitford's hand numbers the pages of the play in
               sequence from 1 to 85. A second hand in pencil has renumbered the folio pages for
               inclusion in this volume of Plays from the Lord Chamberlain's Office, from 415 to
               499.</handNote>

            <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where in the manuscript a
               word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next. Where Mitford’s
               spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate
               searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both
               Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling,
               following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and
               ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

One letter is misfiled in the Lord Chamberlain's folio of plays: does not regard Mitford's play (as noted in the BL catalog). I am transcribing the other six letters in separate files, to be associated with the play. 
            RN: OK. Should I move the cast list here and omit the letters?
         LMW: We/Drama Group should decide whether we are putting the letters in this file or in a separate file. E. has transcribed each in their own file. All need updated header and tagging.  For now, we could put a <note> in here, stating the above. 2017-07-17-->
         <!--2018-05-27 ebb: I think we have two options here: 
         1) Put the letters of transmittal in the Letters module and point to them from here in a note, as LMW suggests, or 
         2) Include them as prefatory matter for the play in this file.
       I recommend option 1) because they are letters, after all. In the drama module (and in every literary module) on the landing page, we are planning to pull in a listing of all other files in the Digital Mitford project that refer to the play, and the letters of transmittal can be incorporated that way. ERR and Drama Group, do you agree? If so, can you extract the letters from this file, and set each in the standard template for letters, fleshing the out the headers as best you can using the header info on this file, since these came from the BL. We should create new British Library (BL) directory inside the 1825 folder for letters in Box, and file these with the 1825 letters we have.

            <p>The attempt to dramatize <rs type="event" ref="#regicide">one of the most striking
                  events in English History</rs>, and to delineate <rs type="person"
                  ref="#Cromwell_MRM">one of the most remarkable characters</rs> that ever figured
               on the great Theatre of Life, was originally suggested to me by Mr. <persName
                  ref="#Macready_Wm">Macready</persName>, whose earnest recommendation to try my
               hand on <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName>, was at a subsequent period
               stil more strongly enforced by Mr. <persName ref="#Kemble_C">Charles
                  Kemble</persName>; neither of those gentlemen, whose judgment in dramatic affairs
               will hardly be disputed, having foreseen any objection to such an experiment on the
               part of <rs type="person" ref="#Colman_the_Younger">the Licenser</rs> or the <rs
                  type="person" ref="#Duke_Montrose">Lord Chamberlain</rs>. How indeed could they
               have anticipated any obstacle from that quarter, when an acted Tragedy on the same
               story and bearing the same title, written above sixty years ago by Mr. <persName
                  ref="#Havard_Wm">Havard</persName>, and frequently played in by Mr. <persName
                  ref="#Kemble_JP">John Kemble</persName>, was already in possession of the stage,
               and might have been performed without let or hindrance on any night at any Theatre
               whether in Town or Country?</p>

            <p>Unforeseen as it was however, such an obstacle unfortunately arose. Mr. <persName
                  ref="#Colman_the_Younger">Colman</persName> did object not to the details or the
               execution of the piece but to the title and the subject, and as the <persName
                  ref="#Duke_Montrose">Duke of Montrose</persName>, the then Lord Chamberlain,
               confirmed the decision of his <q>Reader of Plays,</q>
               <rs type="person" ref="#Macready_Wm #MRM #Kemble_C">we</rs> submitted to the fiat
               without complaint, though not without remonstrance, and the Tragedy, instead of being
               produced at <placeName ref="#Covent_Garden_Theatre">Covent Garden</placeName> eight
               seasons ago, has remained unacted and unpublished, with little apparent chance of
               representation, until the spirited <rs type="person" ref="#Egerton_Dan #Abbott_Wm"
                  >Managers</rs> of the <placeName ref="#Vict_Theatre">Victoria Theatre</placeName>
               applied to me for permission to bring it forward on a stage honourably distinguished
               in this age of opera and spectacle by its encouragement of the legitimate drama.</p>

            <p>. In acceding to their proposal I beg most earnestly and sincerely to disavow having
               been influenced by any thing like a spirit of defiance toward the Licenser or his
               office. To the <rs type="person" ref="#Duke_of_Devonshire">present Lord
                  Chamberlain</rs> the whole theatrical world, and I myself more particularly, owe
               nothing but respect and gratitude. Under his administration a similar case can hardly
               occur; since, however, a characteristic delicacy might have withheld him from
               rescinding a declared resolution or nullifying a positive decree of his noble
               predecessor, the <persName ref="#Duke_of_Devonshire">Duke of Devonshire</persName> is
               too eminent for liberality and kindness, too tasteful and enlightened a patron of the
               acted Drama, to be led by the fear of an imaginary danger into placing fetters and
               shackles on an art which he loves. He is far more likely to foster and cherish in an
               attempt to pursue at a humble distance, the track of those master poets of all
               countries, who from the first Tragedy of <persName ref="#Aeschylus">
                  <choice>
                     <sic>Eschylus</sic>
                     <reg>Aeschylus</reg>
                  </choice>
               </persName> down to this very hour, have found the subjects of their noblest plays in
               the heart-stirring convulsions, the dark and dangerous conspiracies, the bold and
               daring usurpations, the parricides, and the <orgName ref="#regicides"
                  >Regicides</orgName> of their national annals.</p>

            <p>That Mr. <persName ref="#Colman_the_Younger">Colman</persName>'s scruples arose from
               no ill-will to the writer, but were the offspring of an honest timidity, an
               over-zealous fear, I do not for a moment question. A Licenser must needs be somewhat
               of an alarmist in virtue of his office. But he who apprehends danger to the Monarchy
               from the representation of this Play, because it embodies the <rs type="event"
                  ref="#ChasI_trial">trial</rs> and condemnation of <persName ref="#ChasI">Charles
                  the First</persName>, will do well to suppress, if he can, <bibl
                  corresp="#HistEngland_Hume">the striking narrative of <persName ref="#hume"
                     >Hume</persName>
               </bibl>. In the present universal diffusion of literature and general knowledge, the
               Stage has lost much of its ancient influence over the feelings and passions of the
               multitude. That democratic engine the Press, has swept away the regal supremacy of
               the drama. And even if the Theatre were as powerful as in the days of old,—if the
               tendency of this Play were revolutionary, which I deny,—and if <persName
                  ref="#Cromwell">Cromwell</persName>s were <q>plenty as blackberries,</q>
               <note resp="#lmw">
                  <persName ref="#Falstaff_WS">Falstaff</persName> from <title
                     ref="#HenryIVpt1_play">Henry IV, part one</title>: <quote>If reasons were as
                     plentiful as blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon compulsion,
                     I.</quote> (<ref>II.iv</ref>). A favorite quotation of <persName ref="#MRM"
                     >Mitford</persName>'s, which also appears in other contexts in her
                  letters.</note> which I must be permitted to doubt,—against such a King as
                  <persName ref="#WilliamIV">William the Fourth</persName>, their shafts would fall
               harmless. The Monarch who has earned, as he has done, the honest love of a whole
               people, may defy the subtlest attacks of fanaticism and rebellion.</p>

            <p>Of the Tragedy, considered as a literary production, I shall say little: that is
               before the reader, and must speak for itself. No one can be more conscious than I am
               of its numerous defects, and still more numerous deficiencies; but great as those
               faults may be, they are not the result of negligence or carelessness. It would be the
               worst of all pedantries, female pedantry, were I to enumerate the very many
               cotemporary writers, the Histories, Memoirs, Narratives, and State Papers, the
               Roundhead Sermons and Cavalier Ballads from which I have endeavoured to gather not
               merely an accurate outline— of this great event, but those minute and apparently
               trifling touches which might serve to realize the scene, and supply, by a vivid
               impression of the people and the time, the usual sources of dramatic attraction, the
               interest of story and suspense, from which I was cut off by the nature of my
               subject.</p>

            <p>Many of these allusions, those for instance to the papers concealed in the stuffing
               of the saddle, —to the sowing of the melon seeds, to <persName ref="#ChasI"
                  >Charles</persName>'s constant perusal of <persName ref="#Shakespeare"
                  >Shakespeare</persName> whilst in prison, so prettily recorded by <persName
                  ref="#Milton">Milton</persName>, and to the falling of the head of the <persName
                  ref="#ChasI">king</persName>'s staff in the trial scene,—are mentioned by the best
               writers, and will be immediately recognized by all who are any ways conversant with
               the histories of the time. The anecdote of Lord <persName ref="#Broghill"
                  >Broghill</persName> (afterwards Earl of Orrery), which really happened at a
               subsequent period, is less generally known. He was in <placeName ref="#London_city"
                  >London</placeName> on a mission from <persName ref="#ChasII">Charles the
                  Second</persName> during the early part of <rs type="event" ref="#Protectorate"
                  >the Protectorate</rs>, when <persName ref="#Cromwell">Cromwell</persName>
               discovered, confronted, converted, and employed him, much in the manner that I have
               related.</p>

            <p>The materials of the scene of signing the <title ref="#ChasI_Warrant"
               >warrant</title>, in which I believe that I have given, from the marking of <persName
                  ref="#Marten">Marten</persName>'s cheek to the guiding of <persName
                  ref="#Ingoldsby">Ingoldsby</persName>'s hand, a very faithful version of what
               actually occurred, are chiefly taken from the Defences in the Trials of the
                  Regicides.<note resp="#rnes #lmw">Likely refers to the collections of State Trials
                  collected and edited throughout the eighteenth century and early nineteenth
                  century by Francis Hargrave, William Cobbett, and others. <persName ref="#MRM"
                     >Mitford</persName> likely also had access to collections of memoirs of the
                  regicides from Heneage Finch's works to James Caulfield's.</note> It is certain
               that the Judges, after the condemnation, were panic-struck at their own act; and that
               but for an extraordinary exertion of his singular power over the minds of all with
               whom he came in contact, <persName ref="#Cromwell">Cromwell</persName> would never
               have succeeded in obtaining the signatures of the <orgName
                  ref="#High_Court_of_Justice">Commissioners of the High Court of Justice</orgName>
               to an instrument essential to the completion of <rs type="event" ref="#regicide">this
                  great national crime</rs>, and to the purposes of his own ambition.</p>

            <p>I am not aware of having in any material point departed from the truth of History,
               except in shortening <rs type="event" ref="#ChasI_trial">the trial</rs>, in bringing
               the <persName ref="#Qu_Henrietta">Queen</persName> to <placeName ref="#England"
                  >England</placeName>, and in assigning to <persName ref="#Qu_Henrietta"
                  >Henrietta</persName> the interruption of the sentence, which was actually
               occasioned by <persName ref="#LadyFairfax">Lady Fairfax</persName>; deviations, which
               were vitally necessary to the effect of the drama. I have some doubts also whether
                  <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM">Cromwell</persName> did really get rid of <persName
                  ref="#Fairfax">Fairfax</persName> by dismissing him and <persName ref="#Harrison"
                  >Harrison</persName> to <q>seek the Lord together.</q><note resp="#rnes">Not a
                  direct quotation, but a corruption of the anecdote from Hume's History of England,
                  Volume I, Part E.</note>
               <bibl corresp="#HistEngland_Hume">
                  <persName ref="#hume">Hume</persName> tells the story confidently; but <persName
                     ref="#hume">Hume</persName>, although the most delightful, is by no means the
                  most accurate of historians</bibl>; and the manner in which we are, by the casual
               mention of contemporary writers, as well as by the evidence on the different trials,
               enabled to account for almost every instant of <persName ref="#Cromwell_MRM"
                  >Cromwell</persName>'s time during that eventful morning, goes far in my mind to
               disprove the circumstance.<note resp="#rnes">Source unidentified.</note> But the
               incident is highly dramatic, and so strictly in keeping with the characters of all
               parties, that I have no scruple in assuming it as a fact. The thing might have
               happened, if it did not, and that is excuse enough for the dramatist, although not
               for the historian.</p>

                  <l>Haunted my fancy. Seemed this very room,</l>
                  <l>This dim and waning taper, this dark couch,</l>
                  <l>Beneath whose crimson canopy reclined</l>
                  <l>A form august and stately. The pale ray</l>
                  <l>Of the watch- light dwelt upon his face, and showed </l>
                  <l>His paler lineaments, where m ajesty </l>
                  <l>And manly beauty, and deep trenching t hought,</l>
                  <l>And Care the w rinkler, all were blended now</l>
                  <l>Into one calm and holy pensiveness </l>
                  <l>Softened by slumber. I stood gazing on him</l>
                  <l>With weeping love, as one awake; when sudden</l>
                  <l>A thick and palpable darkness fell around,</l>
                  <l>A blindness, and dull groans and piercing shrieks</l>
                  <l>A moment echoed; then they ceased, and light </l>
                  <l>Burst forth and musick such as the flood</l>
                  <l>Of day-spring at the dawning, rosy, sparkling,</l>
                  <l>An insupportable brightness — a nd i'th' midst,</l>
                  <l>Over the couch, a milk-white dove, which soared </l>
                  <l>Right upward, cleaving with its train of light</l>
                  <l>The Heavens like a star. The couch remained</l>
