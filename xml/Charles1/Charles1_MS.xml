            <note>This edition compares Mitford's manuscript [1825] against the published text of
               1834. <!--EBB: Check other published versions: Cumberland's acting copy? #rnes: OK. Where can I find this, please?

               Variants are recorded from the manuscript held in the British Library, originally
               submitted in 1825 to the Examiner's office.</note>
            <note>The hand in the manuscript is Mary Russell Mitford's. Mitford tends to write out
               the full character names, whereas published versions abbreviate. For this variant
               edition, we are not recording distinctions in delineating the speaker names in the
               manuscript vs. published version when the speakers are identical.</note>

            <handNote>In the manuscript of 1825, Mitford's hand numbers the pages of the play in
               sequence from 1 to 85. A second hand in pencil has renumbered the folio pages for
               inclusion in this volume of Plays from the Lord Chamberlain's Office, from 415 to
               499.</handNote>

            <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where in the manuscript a
               word is split at the end of a line and the beginning of the next. Where Mitford’s
               spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate
               searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both
               Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling,
               following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and
               ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

         <!--EBB: Aug 1 2013: In the MS, the cast list appears next, followed by more letters. One letter is misfiled in the Lord Chamberlain's folio of plays: does not regard Mitford's play (as noted in the BL catalog). I am transcribing the other six letters in separate files, to be associated with the play. 
            RN: OK. Should I move the cast list here and omit the letters?
         LMW: We/Drama Group should decide whether we are putting the letters in this file or in a separate file. E. has transcribed each in their own file. All need updated header and tagging.  For now, we could put a <note> in here, stating the above. 2017-07-17-->
         <!--2018-05-27 ebb: I think we have two options here: 
         1) Put the letters of transmittal in the Letters module and point to them from here in a note, as LMW suggests, or 
         2) Include them as prefatory matter for the play in this file.
       I recommend option 1) because they are letters, after all. In the drama module (and in every literary module) on the landing page, we are planning to pull in a listing of all other files in the Digital Mitford project that refer to the play, and the letters of transmittal can be incorporated that way. ERR and Drama Group, do you agree? If so, can you extract the letters from this file, and set each in the standard template for letters, fleshing the out the headers as best you can using the header info on this file, since these came from the BL. We should create new British Library (BL) directory inside the 1825 folder for letters in Box, and file these with the 1825 letters we have.
