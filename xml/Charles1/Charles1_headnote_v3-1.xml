         <!-- 2022-10-01 ebb: Headnote makes a few sweeping generalizations on the basis of a reading of MRM's "The Roundhead's Daughter" in Finden's Tableaux. Review this. 
            Also note 2019 post from the BL on the Examiner of Plays, which features the censorship of Charles I with some details on the correspondence of Colman and Montrose. 
         See BL blog: https://blogs.bl.uk/untoldlives/2019/07/page/2/ 

   Can we provide more detail/perspective on 18th-c performances of Charles I? (Were there any productions post 1770s?) 
   Mitford's letters could use more precise reference here too: Review her letters related to the play where she comments on her surprise about the censorship 
   given that Charles I was performed in 18th c. The headnote

            her. Perhaps it should not have. On Saturday, <date when="1649-01-26">26 January

            and sentenced to death. The sentence was carried out four days later, on a scaffold

               >Jones</persName> had also been a designer of stage sets, so the execution of the
            once-royal prisoner, who approached wearing densely bejewelled gloves, might have seemed
            particularly theatrical. But a generation later, in <date when="1660">1660</date>, the
            English monarchy was restored, under <persName ref="#ChasI">Charles</persName>'s son
               <persName ref="#ChasII">Charles II</persName>. In that year, the Act of Indemnity and
            Oblivion criminalized any discussion of <rs type="event" ref="#regicide">the

               ref="#dsa">Diego Saglia</persName> has demonstrated that many plays produced in the

            opening of the Age of Reform investigate the concept of liberty, and <persName

            the medieval Italian rebel (or demagogue) <persName ref="#Rienzo_hist">Cola di

            ambition. <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> indicates this hypocrisy early in the
            drama, by giving <persName ref="#Cromwell">Cromwell</persName> conspiratorial asides
            reminiscent of those of <persName ref="#Shakespeare">Shakespeare</persName>'s (and

               >Harrison</persName>'s unspoken wish, then engineers its dread fulfillment as a
            communal act. And yet, he also persuasively champions political liberty. He warns the
            would-be Regicides that should <persName ref="#ChasI">Charles</persName> survive, he
            will avenge himself. Then:</p>

            <l>The liberty for which the blood of saints</l>

         <p>Surely this is a paean to liberty, no matter its motivation.</p>
         <p><persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName>'s representation of <persName ref="#ChasI"
               >Charles</persName> seems equally diplomatic. <persName ref="#ChasI"

               >Mitford</persName> embraces psychological and moral complexity, making <persName
               ref="#ChasI">Charles</persName> at once a loving father, an impassioned husband, and
            a disastrous king. <persName ref="#Queen_Ch1">Henrietta Maria</persName>, <persName
               ref="#ChasI">Charles</persName>'s French queen, displays similar depth--and
            frequently steals the scene. Anachronistically styling herself a Gothic heroine,
               <persName ref="#Queen_Ch1">Henrietta Maria</persName> stalks castle corridors in
            search of her imprisoned love, rails at his enemies, and, when she finds him, offers to
            trade her life for his via a ruse that strongly anticipates <persName
